Getting-Cleaning-Data
=====================
Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Execution steps

Download the data source from the links provided in the course project
Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset
Set your working directory using setwd() function
Execute source("run_analysis.R") to generate tiny_data.txt
Required Libraries

run_analysis.R file will install the required dependencies if they are not already installed. The course project depends on reshape2 and data.table.

Output

The output file called tiny_data.txt is generated and placed in the parent folder where run_analysis.R resides.
